<h3>Your assignment</h3>

<p>In this next piece of your programming project, you are assigned to
maintain and extend the micro-Scheme interpreter you've built,
specifically to replace the standard <tt>map</tt> you've been using for your
symbol tables, instead using your own new <tt>hashtablemap</tt> implementation of a
dictionary data structure based on hash tables).</p>

<p>For this assignment, we are giving you almost no new code. The tarball
a7.tar.gz contains exactly the same files as a4.tar.gz, except for (1) these
instructions and (2) a new <tt>hashtablemap.hpp</tt> interface, which you will need
to implement.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Implement hashtablemap</h3>

<p>Look at <tt>hashtablemap.hpp</tt>. This is a subset of the standard C++ library's
interface for the <tt>map</tt> dictionary data structure. (To keep your life
simple, we have omitted extra niceties such as reverse iterators and memory
allocation options.)</p>

<p>Implement a hash table, supporting exactly this interface. To
handle collisions, you may choose either open addressing or separate
chaining. If you use separate chaining, then for each bucket you may
use either the standard linked list approach, or (if you wish) a
binary search tree instead, re-using your bstmap implementation.</p>

<p>Since this is template based code, all the new code will need to go into the
<tt>.hpp</tt> file.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Replace all uses of std::map</h3>

<p>You are now in a position to eliminate the use of the standard <tt>map</tt>
dictionary. Globally replace all uses with your own <tt>hashtablemap</tt> instead
throughout your code. Make sure that your entire micro-Scheme implementation
still does exactly what it used to do.</p>

<h3>Putting it all together and testing your implementation</h3>

<p>Except for your new <tt>hashtablemap.hpp</tt> and any other supporting files, all
other source files in <tt>a5.tar.gz</tt> are identical to those from
<tt>a3.tar.gz</tt>.</p>

<p>So you should start from your Assignment 4 (or Lab Assignment 6)
implementation and extend it. Be careful! You still may not break any of the
encapsulation rules from Assignment 3.</p>

<p>Remember again, the objective of this programming project is for you to
train your skills, by practicing correct software engineering techniques
enabling you to build, maintain, and extend a non-trivial piece of
well-engineered code.</p>

<h3>Important reminders</h3>

<p>You must follow the design approach outlined in this document. Do
<em>not</em> just implement the required functionality using a different
design.</p>

<p>This time you <em>must</em> use templates. In this assignment, you are
expected to make good use of the STL <tt>map</tt> interface for your own new
<tt>hashtablemap.hpp</tt> - but neatly, without messing up what you already have.</p>

<p>Again, remember we are focusing on proper use of encapsulation. So you still
should <em>not</em> edit the files <tt>parse.hpp</tt>, <tt>parse.cpp</tt>,
<tt>cons.hpp</tt>, <tt>eval.hpp</tt>, or <tt>main.cpp</tt>. Again, the
programming assignments are mini-exercises in how multiple programmers are
supposed to interact and communicate in the real world; these files are
<em>owned</em> and <em>maintained</em> by the other author(s).</p>

<p>The tarball you turn in will need to contain your new implementation of
<tt>hashtablemap.hpp</tt>.</p>

<p>Depending on your approach, you may or may not need to change the
<tt>Makefile</tt>. Whether you changed it or not, always make sure you include
whatever <tt>Makefile</tt> is needed to build your program, when you submit
assignment. Otherwise, the graders cannot build your program.</p>

<p>You must write the final version of the program on your own. Sophisticated
plagiarism detection systems are in operation, and they are pretty good at
catching copying! If you worked in study groups, you must also acknowledge your
collaborators in the write-up for each problem, whether or not they are
classmates. Other cases will be dealt with as plagiarism. Re-read the policy on
the course home page, and note the University's tougher policy this year
regarding cheating.</p>

<p><strong>Your programming style (how clearly and how well you speak C++) is
what will be graded. Correct functioning of your program is necessary but not
sufficient!</strong></p>
